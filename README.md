Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data 
[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series). Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. Time series data have a natural temporal ordering. This makes time series analysis distinct from cross-sectional studies, in which there is no natural ordering of 
the observations. A stochastic model for a time series will generally reflect the fact that observations close together in time will be more closely related than observations further apart.

This repository contains python notebooks with time series exploratory data analysis and forecasting.
